## About Me

Creative-minded engineer from **Nicaragua**, blending tech, design, and a touch of espresso into everything I build.

Studied **Electrical Engineering** + **Computer Science** at John Brown University — but what really fuels me is making tools that feel human: intuitive, beautiful, and purposeful.
